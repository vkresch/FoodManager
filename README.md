# Food Manager

FoodManager let's you document your food items which you have at home. Based on these items you can define recipes and always know which recipes you can cook based on the items you have available. You get automatically statistics about the recipe for example how much it costs and weights.

You can also use the app as a shopping list. Select a recipe you saved and add it to the cart. The cart will have all the items inside them which you need to buy to be able to cook the recipe.

FoodManager is currently under develeopment and is the first release to get feedback from the users. Please report any issues, feature requests and bugs on  https://github.com/vkresch/FoodManager/issues. FoodManager was developed with the Python Kivy Framework.

Enjoy the app!
