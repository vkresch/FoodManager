# [Food Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.foodmanager.foodmanager&hl=en_US)

With FoodManager, you can easily keep track of the ingredients in your kitchen and use that information to plan delicious meals. Simply add your food items to the app, and it will show you all the recipes you can make with the ingredients you have on hand. Plus, FoodManager provides automatic nutritional information for each recipe, so you can see exactly how much a meal will cost and how many calories it contains.

But that's not all â€“ FoodManager also doubles as a handy shopping list. Simply select a recipe you want to make, and the app will add all the necessary ingredients to your cart. That way, you'll always know exactly what to buy at the store.

FoodManager is still under development, so please let us know if you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions for new features. We'd love to hear your feedback at https://github.com/vkresch/FoodManager/issues. FoodManager was built using the Python Kivy Framework.

Happy cooking!
